# OpenRCT2HighScoreRemover
Program to remove selected OpenRCT2 high scores

## How to use

Type `python3 change_highscores.py` in your terminal of choice (like Powershell or bash)

## Compatibility

Only tested it on Linux, maybe I'll try Windows some day. I feel like the format was the same on windows and this should work though.

## Contributing

I'll look at issues and pull requests, but the program probably doesn't need much
